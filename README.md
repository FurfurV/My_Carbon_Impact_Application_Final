# My_Carbon_Impact_Application_Final

_My Carbon impact application.
I know that how we live our lives has a massive impact on the environment.
I want a little help with trying to reduce my Carbon foot print.
I want to monitor my everyday activities and get an idea as to their effect on the environment.
I intend to use this to change my lifestyle slightly and be more environmentally friendly._

## The application uses 
* MVC
* Junit testing with a test suite
* Javadoc
* a button when pressed causes the application to use too much memory
